### Please describe found weak places below.

#### Security issues

1. Lack of Strong Parameters: In the create method/action of the TransactionsController, @transaction is created using params[:transaction].permit!. This allows mass assignment of all attributes, which can be a security risk. Therefore we need to use strong parameters to whitelist and validate the parameters.

2. No Authentication and Authorization: There doesn't appear to be any authentication or authorization logic in place. Ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do. We need to use a gem like Devise for user authentication and pundit or cancancan for authorization.

#### Performance issues

1. N+1 Query Issue: In the TransactionsController#index action, all transactions are retrieved using Transaction.all. This can lead to N+1 query issues if associations are also loaded. As the data will increase, we will see that it will become a performance issue. so me must use eager loading (e.g., Transaction.includes(:manager).all) to reduce the number of queries.

2. Random Manager Selection: In the new and create methods, a random manager is selected using Manager.all.sample. This may not be efficient as the number of transactions and managers grow. Therefore we need to consider a more optimized way to select managers, possibly using a round-robin assignment or a load-balancing approach.

#### Code issues

1. Inconsistent Naming: The method for checking if a transaction is "extra large" is named extra_large?, but the param check in the create method uses params[:type] == 'extra'. It's better to keep naming consistent, e.g., params[:type] == 'extra_large'.

2. Monetize Gem: The monetize gem is used for currency conversions, which is a good choice. However, it may require additional configuration and handling of exchange rates.

#### Others

1. Documentation: There is a lack of comments and documentation in the code. Adding comments to describe complex logic, associations, and methods is always better.

2. Testing: There don't appear to be any test cases in the code. Writing tests using a framework like RSpec or Minitest would be beneficial for ensuring the correctness of the code. It is infact something very crucial to ensure code runs as expected in all scenarios and edge cases.

3. Code Duplication: The new methods in the TransactionsController seem to share a lot of code. We should refactor this to reduce code duplication. I have also created partial for view to follow DRY principle.
